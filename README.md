### Everything I learnt about writing goes here.
Follow **POWER** strategey of Steve.
* Strategic reading refers to scanning of information while close reading means reading word by word.
    * Scan for information and close read parts that relate to your interests.
    * Close read abstracts and conlcusions.
    * Research has shown that readers who scan material and take notes retain more info than close readers.
    * You will more likely to miss key points if you read word for world.
* A well organized essay has paragrapghs that are of same length except for first and last one.
    * 5 sentetnces per paragraph.
* Literature review:
    * Download article. Add it in Mendely Library. Open it in Mendely. Read according to your reading strategy.
    * Comparative matrix and/or annotated bibliography are two common tools to organize literature review.
    * Find articles > Compile Bibliography > Assemble Comparative Matrix, Draw Inferences > Refine Your Topic and Research Question > Read Selected Articles More Closely > Create an Annotated Bibliography with an Introductory Paragraph Than Indicates What Your Research Question Are.
    * OR Read Few Articles > Make an Annotated Bibliography > Refine Your Reserach Question > Assemble More Articles > Compile Comparative Matrix, Draw Inferences > Expand Your Annotated Bibliography.
    * Create an excel with three sheet : 1st for Bibliograhy/Database, 2nd for Comparative Matrices, and 3rd for Annotated Bibliography.
